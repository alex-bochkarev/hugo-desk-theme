#+TITLE: Hugo 'Desk' theme

The theme is made from scratch with [[https://gohugo.io][Hugo]], and uses SVG icons by [[https://svgrepo.com][svgrepo]], with
the aim to have a simple, (hopefully) JS-free, but nice theme.

In case you have noticed a typo, or have any other suggestion or comment ---
please open an issue here in the repo, or [[https://www.bochkarev.io/contact][contact]] me in any other
convenient way.

* Notes on setup
** =config.toml=
   Several things are defined here:
   #+begin_src toml
    title = "<default title>" # for tabs and collapsed menu on narrow screens. E.g., initials
    
[Author]
    name = "<author-name>"
    email = "<default-email>"

# General parameters
[params]
    twitter = "<twitter-handle>"
    github = "<github-uname>"
    keybase = "<keybase-uname>"
    tg = "<telegram-id>"

# Menu
[menu]
    # Main topline menu
    [[menu.main]]
      name = "Section1"
      url = "/section1/"
      weight = 1
    [[menu.main]]
      name = "Section2"
      url = "/section2/"
      weight = 2
    # ...
    
    # Icons top-right-corner menu
    [[menu.side]]
      name="i-envelope"
      url="mailto:your@email.tld"
      weight=1
    [[menu.side]]
      name="i-key"
      url="/your-gpg-key"
      weight=1
    # ...
    
# needed to provide inline HTML in your content
[markup.goldmark.renderer]
    unsafe= true
   #+end_src
   
   Note that available icons for the top menu are defined in =static/icons.svg=
   (in the theme directory) -- this is a plain-text file (with =SVG= instructions).
   
** Site footer
   Note that it adds links to files generated from =privacy.md= and
   =disclaimer.md= if they are found in your =content= folder.
